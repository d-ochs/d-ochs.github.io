We got a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08397">new arxiv preprint on Scalable Neural-Probabilistic Answer Set Programming!</a>. Check out how we used SLASH for VQA and how you can prune stochastically insignificant parts of the (ground) program to speed up reasoning without sacrificing predictive performance.
